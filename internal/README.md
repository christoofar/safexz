# Where is lzma?

This is a vendored-in folder (`go get still won't do submodules... :sadge:`) that is pointing to the [lzma repository](https://git.tukaani.org) at [Tukaani.org](https://tukaani.org).

I don't intend to follow Larhzu commit-to-commit, and just have more peace-of-mind following the repo source that the *real* maintainer of xz has full control over.

You can copy and paste the git shorthash showing here on gitlab into the searchbox of his gitweb (top right of screen) to inspect the tree this repo is currently pointing to.
