# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently there is not a published release version as the foundation interface is
currently under development.  I can guarantee to you that the `XZReader` and `XZWriter`
Go interface will not be changing, and these comply and implement their respective
`io.Reader` and `io.Writer` types they expose.
